# IOTA

## [Smart Contracts](https://wiki.iota.org/learn/future/smart-contracts/smart-contracts-introduction)

### 1. EVM ([Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/))

This experimental implementation currently does not have the ability yet to interact with Layer 1 IOTA tokens. Support for this will be brought in a later release.


### 2. WASM ([Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/), TypeScript)
Any high-level language can be used to write an IOTA Smart Contract to be compiled into Wasm. The Wasm VM currently supports TinyGo, a subset of Go, and the Rust programming language.

Rust:<br/>
- small binaries (kilobytes)
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Popular with rich tooling

TinyGo
- Easy to understand & learn
- Go is popular among IOTA ecosystem
- Comfortable developer environment.
